#What we’ve done
- Leaderboard was correctly implemented as a Bootstrap Modal, and added onto the index.html page
- The side navbar on the genre.html page was fixed so that it displays user’s Facebook profile picture, username, and their score. 
- Finished linking up genre page to game page so that the genre query works for each specific genre request
- genre.html is now responsive

#Problems we’ve encountered
- Connecting the front end code to the backend database and testing
- Navigation bar changes after a user is logged in 

#What’s next
- Loading the playlists on the game page from the Spotify API based on the genre query
- Loading facebook information and high score info onto the side bars
- Making Facebook login button look nice
- Testing with dummy data on the games page
- Associating high score with its corresponding user in the database entry
