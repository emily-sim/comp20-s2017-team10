April 7 Progress Update
Group 10
Members: Emily Sim, Sophia Wang, Maddie Payne, Ian Mao, Jose Lemus

#####What we’ve done so far
- We’ve set up the wireframe for the home page, login page, genre-choosing page, and game play page. 
- We have successfully implemented the facebook passport authentication
- We have put in place a side bar that slides out for a user to see their profile details from the right
- We have figured out how to use the spotify API to generate random songs, and how to play a 30 second preview without needing to provide spotify login information
- We have connected our pages 
- We have created a mongodb database that is able to store player data 
- We have successfully implemented code that allows for retrieval of profile info from Facebook through the Facebook JS API
- We have successfully implemented a page that displays the stored data for users


#####Problems we’ve encountered
- Took forever to modify the bootstrap sidebar to come out from the left instead of the right
- Distinguishing the regular Spotify API and the NodeJS Spotify Wrapper
- Making the genre page more responsive without having to rely on Bootstrap
- Updating only specific fields of user’s fields in the database


#####What’s next (until April 14)
- Begin linking up with the Spotify API up with the game page and look into preventing duplicate songs from playing
- Finish linking up the genre page to the game page so that the genre query works for each specific request
- Be done with the user sidebar - both the back and front end
- Fix the responsive design on genre.html so that the 3x3 grid becomes smaller.
